# API Development and Integration

This project develops a RESTful API for a task management app and integrates it with a React.js frontend. It demonstrates designing API endpoints, managing state in React, and securing client-server communication.

## Project Overview

The backend provides RESTful CRUD operations using Express.js and MongoDB, while the React frontend consumes this API for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. Environment variables are used to protect sensitive data.

## Features

- CRUD operations for tasks  
- React state management and routing  
- Secure API communication with environment variables  
- UI enhanced with Bootstrap and React Datepicker.

## Technologies

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose  
- Frontend: React.js, React Router DOM, Axios, Bootstrap, React Datepicker  
- Tools: Nodemon for auto-reload,  Postman for API testing

## Install dependencies for backend and frontend:

cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install

 
## Create a .env file based on .env.example and add your environment variables.

## Run backend and frontend servers:
# In backend folder

npm start

# In frontend folder
npm start
